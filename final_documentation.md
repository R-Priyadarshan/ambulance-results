## Executive Summary

The Ambulance GPS + Traffic Alert System is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to address the critical problem of ambulances getting delayed due to unresponsive traffic. By leveraging GPS tracking, smart traffic signals, and in-vehicle alert mechanisms, this system creates a comprehensive emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) network that significantly reduces response times and enhances road safety.

The system consists of three primary components:
1. **Ambulance-Side IoT Device:** Continuously transmits GPS location and emergency status.
2. **Street-Side IoT Boxes:** Receive preemption commands and control traffic signals while alerting nearby drivers.
3. **Vehicle-Side Prototype:** Optional in-vehicle device that provides direct alerts to drivers.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, hardware specifications, software implementation, and demonstration materials. The proposed solution demonstrates high feasibility, significant innovation, and massive potential impact on emergency response efficiency and public safety.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement
Emergency vehicles, particularly ambulances, often face significant delays due to traffic congestion, leading to increased response times and potentially life-threatening situations. Traditional methods of clearing traffic paths for ambulances, such as sirens and flashing lights, are often insufficient in dense urban environments where drivers may not hear or see the approaching emergency vehicle until it's too late.

### Solution Overview
The Ambulance GPS + Traffic Alert System leverages IoT technology to create a proactive traffic management solution for emergency vehicles. By combining real-time GPS tracking, cloud-based processing, and distributed alert systems, the solution ensures that:

1. Traffic signals along the ambulance's route automatically adjust to prioritize its passage.
2. Drivers receive early notifications about approaching ambulances through visual, audible, and in-vehicle alerts.
3. Emergency dispatchers can monitor the status and progress of ambulances in real-time.

### IoT/Embedded Approach
The system utilizes a network of interconnected IoT devices:

- **Ambulance-Side:** ESP32-based IoT device with GPS and cellular connectivity.
