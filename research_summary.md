# Research Summary: Existing Emergency Vehicle Preemption Systems

## Overview
Emergency Vehicle Preemption (EVP) systems are designed to prioritize the movement of emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) through signalized intersections by temporarily modifying traffic signal patterns to grant them a green light. This minimizes delays and improves response times, enhancing public safety.

## Types of EVP Systems

### 1. Traditional/Legacy Systems
*   **Optical/Acoustic Detection:** These systems typically use optical sensors (detecting strobes on emergency vehicles) or acoustic sensors (detecting siren patterns) to identify an approaching emergency vehicle. Once detected, the system at the intersection triggers a preemption sequence.
*   **Limitations:** Line-of-sight requirements, susceptibility to environmental factors (e.g., fog, heavy rain), and limited range can affect their effectiveness.

### 2. GPS-Based Systems
*   **Technology:** Utilize GPS receivers in emergency vehicles to transmit their precise location to a central system or directly to intelligent traffic controllers at intersections. This allows for more accurate and proactive preemption.
*   **Advantages:** Overcomes line-of-sight limitations, enables preemption from a greater distance, and can facilitate 


staged preemption for multiple lights along a route.
*   **Examples:** Systems like those from Applied Information and EMTRAC utilize GPS and cellular technologies for preemption.

### 3. IoT-Enabled and AI-Driven Systems
*   **Integration:** These systems leverage interconnected devices (IoT), sensors, and intelligent algorithms to monitor and manage traffic flow in real-time.
*   **Ambulance-side IoT Device:** Continuously transmits GPS location and potentially other telemetry data (e.g., speed, direction).
*   **Street-side IoT Boxes (e.g., LoRa/ESP32 with GSM):** Receive GPS data via cloud or mesh networks. These boxes can be integrated with traffic signals to:
    *   Activate sirens and LED panels on traffic signals to alert nearby drivers.
    *   Broadcast alerts to nearby vehicles via FM, Bluetooth Beacons, or dedicated short-range communication (DSRC).
*   **Vehicle-side Prototypes:** Small devices or mobile applications (e.g., Android phones) within vehicles can receive these alerts and provide haptic (buzzing) or visual (flashing) notifications to drivers.
*   **Traffic Signal Integration:** Advanced IoT systems can directly communicate with traffic signal controllers to dynamically adjust signal timings, turning lights green along the ambulance's route.
*   **Benefits:** Enhanced situational awareness for drivers, reduced response times, improved safety for emergency personnel and the public, and potential for data-driven traffic management optimization.

## Key Components and Technologies
*   **GPS:** For accurate location tracking of emergency vehicles.
*   **IoT Devices:** Microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32), low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) like LoRa, and cellular modules (GSM) for communication.
*   **Cloud Platforms:** For data aggregation, processing, and distribution between ambulance-side and street-side devices.
*   **Communication Protocols:** MQTT for IoT messaging, potentially DSRC, Bluetooth, or FM for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.
*   **Traffic Signal Controllers:** Integration points for preemption commands.
*   **Alert Mechanisms:** Sirens, LED panels, in-vehicle alerts (visual/haptic).

## Feasibility and Impact
IoT-enabled and AI-driven ambulance traffic management systems demonstrate high feasibility due to advancements in IoT hardware, wireless communication, and cloud computing. The impact is massive, leading to significantly reduced ambulance response times, fewer accidents involving emergency vehicles, and overall improved urban mobility during emergencies. These systems are also highly demo-friendly, showcasing tangible benefits in real-world scenarios.
